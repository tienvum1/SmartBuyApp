description: Optional guidance for Redux Toolkit and RTK Query
---

#### REDUX

- Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) instead of plain Redux to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the slice pattern for organizing related state, reducers, and actions
- Use RTK Query for data fetching to eliminate manual loading state management
- Prefer createSelector for memoized selectors to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Normalize complex state structures using a flat entities approach with IDs as references
- Implement middleware selectively and avoid overusing thunks for simple state updates
- Use the listener middleware for complex side effects instead of thunks where appropriate
- Leverage createEntityAdapter for standardized CRUD operations
- Implement Redux DevTools for debugging in development environments
- Use typed hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector) with TypeScript for type safety
